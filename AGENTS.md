# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `content/` stores all published pages; match existing section folders such as `content/docs/` and keep front matter in draft until ready.
- Place Hugo layout overrides in `layouts/`, shared CSS/JS in `assets/`, reusable data tables in `data/`, and translations in `i18n/`.
- Add immutable site-wide assets to `static/` (favicons, robots.txt); never edit `public/` because it is regenerated by Hugo.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `hugo mod tidy` synchronizes Hextra modules after dependency changes.
- `hugo server --disableFastRender -p 1313` runs the local preview with live reload.
- `hugo --minify` generates the production site into `public/`; delete `public/` if you need a clean rebuild.
- `hugo --buildDrafts --buildFuture --minify` is the pre-PR check to surface scheduled or draft content issues.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Write Markdown headings in sentence case and use short permalinks (for example, `docs/content-model`).
- Keep front matter keys in `snake_case`, YAML files (like `hugo.yaml`) indented with two spaces, and place custom SCSS/JS under `assets/` using kebab-case names (e.g., `assets/css/custom-banner.scss`).
- Respect existing Hextra component naming when editing layouts and add comments only where logic is non-obvious.

## Testing Guidelines
- There is no automated test suite; rely on Hugo builds to validate changes.
- Before shipping, run `hugo --buildDrafts --buildFuture --minify` and spot-check the rendered pages under `public/` for missing assets or broken links.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Follow the repository history style of conventional prefixes such as `feat : add landing copy`; group related content changes together.
- Pull requests should describe affected sections, note new assets or config keys, link the related issue or discussion, and attach a screenshot or local URL when visual components change.

## Content Workflow Tips
- Create new documentation pages with `hugo new content/docs/<topic>/_index.md`; keep them as drafts until finalized.
- Store supporting images under `static/images/<topic>/` and remove obsolete content or assets when deleting a page to avoid orphaned files.
